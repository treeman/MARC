      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    20 out of   2,278    1%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                        0 out of   4,556    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           47
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            19 out of      47   40%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  13 out of      47   27%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          15 out of      47   31%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
